# awesome-bioinformatics-formats
Curated list of bioinformatics formats and publications. Not every format here is "awesome" persay, but if you are
thinking about creating a new format this could be your first place to look at potential pre-existing formats. We also
include formats not specific to bioinformatics, but should be considered for bioinformatics applications.

## Formats

### General

Formats not specific to bioinformatics that should be considered.

* [HDF5](https://portal.hdfgroup.org/display/support) - HDF5 is a data model, library, and file format for storing and managing data. It supports an unlimited variety of datatypes, and is designed for flexible and efficient I/O and for high volume and complex data. HDF5 is portable and is extensible, allowing applications to evolve in their use of HDF5. The HDF5 Technology suite includes tools and applications for managing, manipulating, viewing, and analyzing data in the HDF5 format.
* [NetCDF](https://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/netcdf/) - Network Common Data Form is a set of interfaces for array-oriented data access and a freely distributed collection of data access libraries for C, Fortran, C++, Java, and other languages.

### Genomic Intervals

Formats associated with storing genomic intervals (e.g., contig, start, stop, strand).

* [BED](https://genome.ucsc.edu/FAQ/FAQformat.html#format1) - Browser Extensible Data format provides a flexible way to define the data lines that are displayed in an annotation track.
* [bedGraph](https://genome.ucsc.edu/goldenPath/help/bedgraph.html) - The bedGraph format allows display of continuous-valued data in track format.
* [bigBed](https://genome.ucsc.edu/goldenPath/help/bigBed.html) - Binary and indexed form of [BED](https://genome.ucsc.edu/FAQ/FAQformat.html#format1)
* [bigWig](https://genome.ucsc.edu/goldenPath/help/bigWig.html) - The bigWig format is useful for dense, continuous data and is a binar form of [wiggle](https://genome.ucsc.edu/goldenPath/help/wiggle.html).
* [narrowPeak](https://genome.ucsc.edu/FAQ/FAQformat.html#format12) - This format is used to provide called peaks of signal enrichment based on pooled, normalized (interpreted) data. It is a BED6+4 format.
* [wiggle](https://genome.ucsc.edu/goldenPath/help/wiggle.html) - ASCII format for dense, continuous data.


### Genotype Data

Formats associated with genotype data.

### Sequencing Data

Formats associated with storing sequencing data.
