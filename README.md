# awesome-bioinformatics-formats
Curated list of bioinformatics formats and publications. Not every format here is "awesome" persay, but if you are
thinking about creating a new format this could be your first place to look at potential pre-existing formats. We also
include formats not specific to bioinformatics, but should be considered for bioinformatics applications.
